/**
 * The weapon selector: a Polymer item the client is shown as a compass, which opens {@link WeaponDialog}
 * when it is clicked in the inventory screen — where it lives, in {@link #SLOT}, the top-right slot of the
 * main grid.
 *
 * <p>An item rather than only a command, because a player who has just joined a lobby has not read the
 * commands and a thing sitting in their inventory asks to be clicked. A compass because it already reads as
 * "point me at something". Polymer sends the item's own id as the client's {@code item_model}, so the pack ships
 * {@code items/weapon_selector.json}: a still compass face (vanilla's {@code compass_16}), because a
 * compass that points somewhere spins its needle while it works out where — without that file the
 * client drew the missing-texture square.
 *
 * <p>The name is on the stack ({@link DataComponents#ITEM_NAME}) rather than left to the lang file: what
 * reaches the client is a compass, and a compass is called Compass unless the stack says otherwise.
