/**
 * What being between matches means for a player: adventure mode and no Rivals kit at all — no gun, no
 * weapon selector, nothing this mod handed them.
 *
 * <p>Adventure because the lobby is not a place to mine the arena from, and because a paint weapon in a
 * lobby is a paint weapon used on the arena before the round starts. Nothing in the kit, because a kit is
 * a match's: a player whose match was stopped is left with the inventory they walked in with rather than a
 * compass they cannot drop. The kit comes back at the next {@code /rivals match start} ({@link Match#arm}),
 * and the pick itself is remembered whatever they are carrying, so it comes back as the weapon they chose.
 *
 * <p>Ops keep whatever mode they are in —
 * an operator in the lobby is usually building it — and the permission asked is the module's own
 * {@code metacraft.rivals}, the same one the admin commands use, so a server with a permissions plugin can
 * hand it out without handing out op.
 *
 * <p>Called from the match's own transitions, from {@code /rivals match} and from the join hook. A player
 * who joins while a match is <em>playing</em> is not given the lobby treatment at all: they are added to
 * the match ({@link Match#addMidMatch}), which arms them and gives them the respawn grace.
 *
 * <p>Respawning in the lobby puts a player on one of the two sides back on that side's own spawn, and
 * everyone else at the world spawn — the same rule as in a match, minus the freeze, so that a lobby death
 * does not scatter people across the map.
