/**
 * The patch catalogue: the art that can be sewn on. A plain patch goes on any cell ({@link Spot})
 * and is normally the cell's size ({@link Spot#PX} square); a bigger one is centred on its cell
 * and hangs over the neighbours — later-sewn on top, the way real ovvar are patched. A seat patch
 * is two cells wide and goes across the seat only, where it may be taller than the cells
 * ({@link #SEAT_HEIGHT_MAX}) and hang onto the cloth below and above them. Adding a patch is one
 * line here plus its PNG at
 * {@code art/ovvar/patches/<id>.png}, then {@code runDatagen}. The first
 * {@value Looks#INSTANT_DESIGNS} cell-sized ones can ride in the dye colour (sewn ones show at once);
 * bigger ones and later ones always go through the pack. Items store patches by id, so the order
 * is otherwise free.
 *
 * <p><b>Per-size art.</b> A patch may ship more than one PNG: the default above, plus any number of
 * {@code <id>_<w>x<h>.png} beside it — art drawn again at a size that suits a particular place,
 * which is cheaper than any amount of scaling or clipping. They are found by file name (nothing to
 * declare: the catalogue entry stays one line), and every path that draws a patch asks
 * {@link #artFor} which of them a place shows, so the item icon, the pack's placement textures, the
 * instant channel's library, the paper doll, the preview glyphs and a stand's sprites can never
 * pick different ones. {@link Fit} is the whole of the decision.
 *
 * <p><b>The sizes nobody drew.</b> A patch drawn at {@link #MAX_ART} px also gets the smaller sizes
 * it does not ship, scaled down from it ({@link #GENERATED_SIZES}); a hand-drawn file of that size
 * always wins, and a seat patch never gets any (its width is the two cells'). Nothing is written to
 * the source tree — a generated {@link Art} carries the art it comes from and whoever wants its
 * pixels scales them ({@code Tex.art(Art)}), so the artist's job is to draw the 16×16 and then draw
 * again only the sizes the scaler gets wrong.

	 *	   losing its edges.
	 *   <li>{@link #FILLED}: a cell as big as art is allowed to get ({@link #MAX_ART} square — the
