 * the collar and the belt (the body's top and bottom texel rows), the hands (the bottom row of
 * the arms), the cuffs (the bottom row of the legs), and the inner faces.
 * Items store cells by name, so entries may be added or removed; the ordinal only travels in the
 * (transient) preview bits. Left/right in sleeve and leg
 * names are the wearer's own; in chest and back names they are as seen by someone facing that
 * side. Sleeve and leg cells sit on the right limb's strips: the armour model draws the left limb
 * as a mirror image off the same strips, and the shader tells the two apart by the handedness
 * of the texture mapping, so a LEFT cell is the same rectangle drawn only on mirrored fragments
 * (with its art flipped back).
 *
 * Box strips (rows 20–32): body 16 right | 20 front | 28 left | 32 back; arm 40 outer | 44 front
 * | 48 inner | 52 back; leg 0 outer | 4 front | 8 inner | 12 back.
 *
 * Nearly every cell is on those side rows. The exception is a cell on a box's <em>top</em> face,
 * rows {@value #TOP_ROW}–{@value #FACE_ROW} of the strip's second block of four columns (the
 * shoulders): {@link #top} tells the two kinds apart and {@link #face} answers {@value #TOP_FACE}
 * for the top one. A top face has no neighbour to bend onto in the layout, so art bigger than a
 * top cell is <b>clipped</b> to the face rather than wrapped round it.
