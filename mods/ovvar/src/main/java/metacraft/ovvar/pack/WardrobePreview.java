/**
 * The wardrobe screen's preview: the player's whole ovve — top and trousers as one figure — drawn
 * in the screen's title, from four sides, and turned by the buttons at the end of the tab row.
 *
 * <p>A vanilla client cannot draw an entity inside a chest screen, so the preview is a
 * <em>paper doll</em>: the humanoid model's faces, cut out of the very equipment-layer textures
 * the client draws the garment with, laid out flat as a standing figure. Front and back show the
 * arms beside the torso and the legs below it; a side shows the body's own side face with the
 * sleeve beside it and the trouser leg below, which is where that side's cells are.
 *
 * <p><b>It is built up in layers, not baked per design.</b> One glyph per (chapter, angle) draws
 * the bare garment, and one small glyph per (patch, cell, angle) draws that patch exactly where it
 * lands on the doll — cropped to its own art, so the glyph is a dozen pixels square, and placed by
 * space advances and its ascent. The title stacks the bare ovve and then one glyph per sewn
 * placement, so a design is composed at the moment the screen opens: the pack holds a fixed
 * {@code chapters × 4 + Σ patches-per-cell × 1} glyphs, never grows with what anybody sews, and
 * nothing has to be regenerated or pushed when a patch goes on. A cell is on exactly one face of
 * one box, and a face is seen from exactly one of the four angles, so a cell has exactly one glyph
 * per patch — and the cells you cannot see from an angle simply have none. The shoulders are the
 * one exception, being on the arm boxes' <em>top</em> faces: a top face is turned away from every
 * one of the four sides, so the front and the back views each draw it <b>foreshortened</b> — its
 * four texel rows averaged in pairs into two, a {@value #CAP}-px cap sitting on the top of the
 * sleeve column (nothing else on the figure moves). The same face from the two opposite sides, so
 * the back view's cap is the front view's turned through 180°. {@link #angleOf} names the front
 * one, which is where a shoulder's tooltip goes; both views have a glyph for it.
 *
 * <p>Sizes: the source textures hold {@link Spot#DETAIL} texels per skin pixel, but every face is
 * first dropped back to the art's own {@link Spot#ART_DETAIL} — lossless, since datagen scaled the
 * art up by exactly that factor — and the doll is drawn at {@value #PX} screen px per skin pixel,
 * so every face is resampled ×1.5 from art (which keeps every texel the patch art has, at the
 * price of every other column being 2 px wide). Everything that measures where art lands on the
 * doll therefore counts in art pixels, {@link #AD} per skin texel; {@link #D} is only for cutting
 * a face out of the texture. The bare
 * doll is shaded — the viewer's right darker, either arm darker again, a seam at the waist — and
 * given a 1 px dark outline drawn on its own outermost pixels, so it reads as a figure and not as
 * a strip of faces; a patch layer takes the same shading, and keeps off the outline's own pixels so
 * a patch at the edge of a sleeve cannot break the figure's edge.
