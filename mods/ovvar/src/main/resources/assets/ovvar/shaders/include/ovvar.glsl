//
// A texture of ours is the 64×32 armour layout at OVVAR_D texels per texel (256×128), with a
// marker texel at (W−1, H/2−1): magenta, alpha 2/255. The texel left of it says what it is (R):
//   0  a base garment texture. The model draws the left arm and leg as mirror images off the right
//	  limb's strips; on those fragments the shader samples one strip up, where the left-side art
//	  lives.
//   1  a placement texture: one patch drawn on one cell, for one side (G: 0 body, 1 right limb,
//	  2 left limb) on one face of its strip (B: 0..3, or 4 — Spot.TOP_FACE — for the box's top
//	  face, which is not on the strip: the shoulders). Fragments of the other limb read the
//	  blank texel.
//   2  the preview texture: every instant design's art in a library (head rows), a cell table at
//	  x 40·D (index in the half → u, v, side, in texels; column-major, 16 tall; 3·D columns
//	  further right: the cell's own width and height, since a cell is not one size — the big back
//	  cell is two cells each way and the seat two wide; its B is Spot.layer, which of two
//	  overlapping cells is drawn on top; a v above the side rows means the cell is
//	  on the box's TOP face, the shoulders) and a design
//	  table 3·D columns further right again (design + fit·OVVAR_FIT_SLOTS → library x, y, cells;
//	  3·D columns further right: art width, height — a row per art the design can be drawn as,
//	  since a patch may ship its art at several sizes); G = cells in the half, B = designs. The garment's dye
//	  colour carries up to three placements as the rank of their set among all sets of
//	  (cell × designs + design) states, after all smaller sets (0 = none) — packed as three
//	  base-255 digits, each byte one more than its digit, so no byte is ever 0. Everything else
//	  reads the blank texel at (W−1, H/2−2).
//

//
// The unwrap. On a side face the texture's u runs around the box and its v runs DOWN it (+y in
// model space, the model being drawn y-flipped). On the top face v runs ACROSS the box instead,
// from its back edge to its front (-z): that is what puts the top face's last row against the front
// face's first row, which is how the vanilla box unwrap lays the two out, how the skins are drawn,
// and what the game shows (a shoulder patch reads with the art's top towards the wearer's back).
// So only u's direction is in question, and the handedness follows from it — take u ^ v against the
// outward normal:
//
//   front face  u = +x, v = +y, n = -z:  (+x) ^ (+y) = +z, dot(-z) < 0
//   top face	u = +x, v = -z, n = -y:  (+x) ^ (-z) = +y, dot(-y) < 0   -- same as a side face
//   top face	u = -x, v = -z, n = -y:  (-x) ^ (-z) = -y, dot(-y) > 0   -- opposite
//
// The playtest picked between them: taking the answer as INVERTED on the top rows put each
// shoulder's art on the other shoulder, so it is not inverted — u = +x, the top face's u running
// the wearer's right to left, the same way the front face's does. Which is also what the edge they
// share demands: the box's top-front edge is one line in the texture, and the two faces must run
// along it the same way.
//
// Why the earlier playtest (one shoulder drawing, the other bare) says nothing about this: both
// arms' top faces are the very same texels, so `mirrored` is the only thing that can tell them
// apart, and under EITHER sense exactly one of the two shoulder cells is selected per arm — every
// setting predicts both shoulders drawing, one patch each. A bare shoulder is not a state this
// constant can produce; that session's client had not been pushed a pack holding the new cells

// playtest of them could not tell which of the two paintings mattered:
//
//   OVVAR_DEBUG_TOP_FACE_SIDES  the BASE GARMENT layer, which covers every such fragment whatever
//							   is sewn, paints instead of sampling the cloth:
//								 RED   the mirror test calls this fragment mirrored (the left limb),
//								 BLUE  it calls it unmirrored (the right);
//   OVVAR_DEBUG_TOP_FACE_MISS   the PREVIEW layer paints MAGENTA where no cell of the instant
//							   design matched the fragment;
//   OVVAR_DEBUG_TOP_FACE_HIT	the PREVIEW layer paints GREEN where a cell DID match — instead of
//							   the art, so a green face says the shader got all the way to the

// OVVAR_DEBUG_TOP_FACES turns on all three (what the first playtest ran).

//   one green arm, one bare	 the preview path really does reach a cell on only one arm, and
//	   since it reaches both when SIDES paints as well, the base garment layer's own top-face
//	   branch is implicated and that is the thing to change;
//   neither green			   no cell matched at all (turn MISS on too: magenta says the same
